# Voting_Algorithm_Q_Learning
The goal is to use a voting algorithm(I used Boyer Moore's which uses majority voting) to influence the agent as it interacts with the environment. I used the OpenAI Gym environment Taxi-V3. The agent's responsibility is to pick up the passenger at one spot and drop him off at another. There are 4 locations, each of which is identified by a different letter. For a successful drop-off, we score +20 points, and for each additional time-step, we score -1 points. I implemented a voting algorithm for Q-Learning, improving AI agent efficiency. I then leveraged key metrics such as average penalties per episode, timesteps per trip, and rewards per move for evaluation.
